Responsive Portfolio with a Home,About Me, Portfolio, and Contact Pages
Created a responsive portfilio consisting of a navbar, responsive images and layout. Utilizing the bootstrap grid system, it yields a responsive website that reacts to varying device sizes. 
Added the home page for more practice.

I was having trouble submitting my assignments correctly. And while this far behind where our class is now, I didn't want too change my initial work.

I would have had about 8 commits if I could have uploaded my work properly.
